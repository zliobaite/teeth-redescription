Siren --- Interactive Redescription Mining

Siren is an interactive tool for visual and interactive redescription mining.

With a debian-based distribution run the following commands as root to install:
dpkg -i the_latest_siren_deb_package.deb

Afterward, you might need to run, to fix dependencies, i.e., install missing required packages 
sudo apt-get -f install

If everything went fine, you should find a Siren entry in your Applications menu (probably under Science).
